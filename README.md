Description about Planner App:

Custom-made widgets such as the News Headline Widget, Inspirational Quote Widget, and Task Progress
Manager Widget are valuable additions to a planner app as they enhance its functionality and user
experience.

The News Headline Widget provides users with real-time updates and keeps them informed about
current events. It allows users to stay connected to the world while managing their tasks and schedules.
Users can quickly glance at the latest news headlines within the app, saving them the hassle of switching
to a separate news app or website.

The Inspirational Quote Widget brings motivation and positivity to users' planning experience. By
displaying daily inspirational quotes, it encourages users to stay focused, inspired, and determined. Users
can start their day by reading an uplifting quote and use it as a guiding mantra throughout their planning
journey.

The Task Progress Manager Widget helps users track their task completion and stay organized. It
provides a visual representation of task progress, allowing users to prioritize their tasks effectively. Users
can mark tasks as completed, track their progress, and view an overall completion percentage. This
widget empowers users to monitor their productivity and motivates them to achieve their goals.

To use these widgets, users can simply add widget to screen. The News Headline Widget can display a
scrollable list of news headlines, allowing users to click on a headline to read the full article if interested.
The Inspirational Quote Widget can show a new quote every day, refreshing automatically. Users can
read and reflect on the quote, finding inspiration and motivation. The Task Progress Manager Widget can
provide a list of tasks, allowing users to update the status of each task by marking them as complete.
